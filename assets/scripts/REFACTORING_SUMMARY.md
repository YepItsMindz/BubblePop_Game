# Bubble Pop Game - Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The original `main.ts` file has been successfully refactored into separate classes based on functionality. This refactoring improves code maintainability, readability, and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Refactored Classes

### 1. **GameManager.ts** (formerly main.ts)

- **Purpose**: Main game coordinator and lifecycle management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Game state management (gameActive, isMovingToMinLine, etc.)
  - Component initialization and coordination
  - Game lifecycle (onLoad, onDestroy, update)
  - Map movement and game end detection
  - Provides access to other managers through getter methods

### 2. **BubbleFactory.ts**

- **Purpose**: Creating and managing bubble instances
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Creating initial bubble maps
  - Adding new rows efficiently
  - Individual bubble creation
  - Setting bubble positions on the grid

### 3. **InputHandler.ts**

- **Purpose**: Handling user input and raycasting
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Mouse move and click event handling
  - Raycast creation and collision detection
  - Ray reflection off walls
  - Predicted bubble positioning
  - Position calculation utilities

### 4. **BubbleAnimator.ts**

- **Purpose**: Bubble movement and animation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Bubble movement calculations
  - Animation timing and execution
  - Path calculation for bubble trajectory
  - Distance and position utilities
  - Adjacent bubble detection for matching

### 5. **GraphicsRenderer.ts**

- **Purpose**: Visual rendering of graphics elements
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Line drawing for aim trajectory
  - Graphics initialization and clearing
  - Stroke rendering

### 6. **BubbleDestroyer.ts**

- **Purpose**: Bubble matching and destruction logic
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Finding connected bubbles of the same color
  - Destroying matched bubble groups (3 or more)
  - Managing destruction effects
  - Sprite frame comparison

### 7. **FallingBubbleManager.ts**

- **Purpose**: Managing disconnected/falling bubbles
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Detecting bubbles disconnected from the top
  - Managing falling bubble animations
  - Top row bubble identification
  - Connected bubble traversal

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Improved Testability

Individual classes can be tested in isolation, making unit testing more feasible.

### Better Code Organization

Related functionality is grouped together, making it easier to locate and modify specific features.

### Reduced Coupling

Classes interact through well-defined interfaces, reducing dependencies between different parts of the system.

### Easier Maintenance

Bug fixes and feature additions can be made to specific classes without affecting others.

## Usage

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility. The original `main` class is now exported as `GameManager`, so existing scenes and prefabs should continue to work without modification.

To use the new architecture:

1. Attach the `GameManager` component to your main game node
2. The GameManager will automatically instantiate and coordinate all other managers
3. All original functionality remains intact

## File Structure

```
assets/scripts/
├── main.ts (now exports GameManager for compatibility)
├── GameManager.ts (main coordinator)
├── BubbleFactory.ts
├── InputHandler.ts
├── BubbleAnimator.ts
├── GraphicsRenderer.ts
├── BubbleDestroyer.ts
├── FallingBubbleManager.ts
└── prefab/
    ├── bubblesPrefab.ts
    └── destroyBubble.ts
```

## Constants

The following constants remain accessible from the main module:

- `BUBBLES_SIZE = 68`
- `MAP_FALL_SPEED = 20`

These are now exported from `GameManager.ts` and re-exported through `main.ts` for compatibility.
